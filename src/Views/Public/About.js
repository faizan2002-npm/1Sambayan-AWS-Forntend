                                            The movement began in September 2020, when
                                            economic recession and unemployment due to
                                            the COVID-19 pandemic had set in, the number
                                            of infections kept rising, and the incumbent
                                            administration had shown itself incapable of a
                                            sensible, effective response to the crisis.

                                            Election lawyer Atty. Howard Calleja spoke with
                                            Jesuit priest Fr. Albert Alejo and La Salle Brother
                                            Armin Luistro about the urgency of preparing for the
                                            next election. That started a series of meetings that
                                            attracted patriotic personalities who wanted to find a
                                            way of restoring good governance in the country. They
                                            spoke with government officials, politicians, sectoral
                                            group leaders, and businessmen, who all agreed that
                                            Filipinos deserve much better leadership than the
                                            current one.

                                            But there wasn’t much that can be done under the
                                            regime. The group knew the battle would be in the
                                            May 9, 2022 national elections. Thus, their work was cut
                                            out for them: The democratic forces must fall behind a
                                            single slate of national candidates to ensure victory.

                                            The next step was to enlist the help of prominent,
                                            credible personalities with unquestioned integrity
                                            to lead the new group, particularly in its task of
                                            nominating prospective national candidates.

                                            First to come to mind was retired Supreme Court
                                            Justice Antonio Carpio, legal luminary and champion
                                            in the fight for the country’s sovereignty in the
                                            West Philippine Sea. He agreed to join the group in
                                            a heartbeat, and proposed to make it an inclusive
                                            coalition of democratic forces.

                                            “The unifying factor among all of these groups is that
                                            they believe that we should prevent an authoritarian
                                            government from taking hold in the Philippines in the
                                            next election,” says Carpio, who has been chosen by
                                            the coalition to be 1SAMBAYAN’s chairman.

                                            human rights, integrity, and honesty in government,”
                                            he adds.

                                            Through Carpio’s invitation, two other champions of
                                            democracy and justice joined 1SAMBAYAN: retired
