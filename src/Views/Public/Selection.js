                                            From this shortlist, members of the groups in the

                                            they want their candidates to be. The coalition may
                                            also make available certain modes through which
                                            the general public may select candidates for the
                                            Opposition.

                                            Meanwhile, the coalition’s convenors will thoroughly
                                            interview each aspirant and examine their eligibility
                                            and qualifications for office. The aspirants must prove
                                            themselves worthy, competent, and prepared to
                                            address the country’s many problems

                                            Striking a balance between the aspirants’ winnability
                                            and qualifications, 1SAMBAYAN will then decide who
